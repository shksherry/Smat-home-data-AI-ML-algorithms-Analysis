The provided code offer a comprehensive approach to anomaly detection and classification tasks using machine learning algorithms. Starting with anomaly detection, the Isolation Forest algorithm is applied, covering data preprocessing, model implementation, and visualization of results. Subsequently, various anomaly detection algorithms are systematically compared, evaluating their accuracies and aiding in algorithm selection. Visualizations, such as horizontal bar plots, provide clear insights into the performance of different algorithms. Finally, the classification of malicious and non-malicious attacks using a Random Forest Classifier is demonstrated, including preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation via a confusion matrix. Together, these snippets offer a robust methodology and visualization techniques for practical analysis and interpretation of anomaly detection and classification tasks.
